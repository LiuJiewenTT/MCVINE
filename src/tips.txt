MC Violent Insertion NeteaseEdition

Version: 1.4
Auther: TTPeter


-Installation:
Modify path of '.minecraft' of those in the FOLLOWING FILES:
	mc.bat & frmc.bat
	export*.bat
	import*.bat
Then, create a dictionary in this category and put everything that you intend to insert into '.minecraft'.

ALL SET! READY!


-Notice:
1. When there is a newly installed version of game and it's your first run, you should run frmc.bat instead of mc.bat.
2. Usually, import.bat wouldn't run import_weSchem.bat automatically after its main part's run.
3. You may not edit any file except those mentioned in Installation instruction.

-Use:
1. Before starting your game, you should run mc.bat, which is to run run.bat. Same for frmc.bat.

2. After your playing, and BEFORE NEXT PLAY, you should run export.bat to update your data from game to "the local". In this way, your newest data would be exported and could be import again to make sure nothing to be changed  when you enter the next play.

3. You can run *_weSchem.bat without runing *.bat.
